# Contributing to Sigistry

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sigistry! We're excited to see what plugins and skills you'll create. Plugins install natively in Claude Code; the skills they ship are also listed individually at [sigistry.com/skills](https://sigistry.com/skills), served through our MCP server, and portable to any agent that reads the SKILL.md standard.

Listing is consent-first and free. You can request delisting of your own work at any time.

## How to Submit a Plugin

### Listed vs. Verified

The registry has three tiers:

- **Listed**: your plugin stays in your own repository and `marketplace.json` points at it (the Git-URL flow below), with no commit pin. It gets structural validation and human review, and users install it directly from your repo. Listed plugins do not carry the verification badge, because nothing pins what the code is: you could change it at any time after review.
- **Verified at commit** (externally hosted): your plugin stays in your repository, and you also add a commit pin (repo + SHA + path) to `.claude-plugin/external-pins.json`. The verifier clones exactly that commit and runs the full methodology against it. Your badge reads `verified @<short-sha>`, a claim that stays true forever, and a daily drift watchdog flips it to `outdated` the moment your repo HEAD moves past the pin. Re-verify a new version by bumping the pin in a PR.
- **Verified** (strongest): your plugin is vendored into this repository under `plugins/<your-plugin-name>/` via PR. It must pass the eight-check [verification methodology](https://sigistry.com/verification) (manifest integrity, hook safety, agent tool scopes, command hygiene, skill structure, skill safety, no secrets, documentation) plus a human review of hook and agent code. CI re-verifies on every change, so the badge always describes exactly what users install:

[![Verified by Sigistry](https://sigistry.com/badge/verified.svg)](https://sigistry.com/verification)

To go for **Verified**, follow the same steps below, but include your full plugin under `plugins/<your-plugin-name>/` with `"source": "./plugins/your-plugin-name"` in your `marketplace.json` entry, and run the verifier before opening the PR:

```bash
# Self-check your plugin (the exact checks CI will run):
node scripts/verify-plugins.mjs path/to/your-plugin

# Then regenerate the registry state and commit both files with your PR:
node scripts/verify-plugins.mjs           # -> .claude-plugin/verified.json
node scripts/generate-skills-index.mjs    # -> .claude-plugin/skills.json
```

Prefer the browser? The [free checker](https://sigistry.com/claude-plugin-checker) runs the same eight checks against any public repository without uploading anything.

CI (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) fails any PR where a plugin fails a check or where `.claude-plugin/verified.json` is stale, so the badge can never drift from the code.

### 1. Prepare Your Plugin

Your plugin must follow the Claude Code plugin structure:

```
your-plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: Plugin metadata
├── commands/                # Optional: Custom slash commands
│   └── your-command.md
├── agents/                  # Optional: Custom agents
├── skills/                  # Optional: Skills (auto-loaded when they apply)
│   └── your-skill/
│       ├── SKILL.md         # name + description frontmatter, then the skill
│       └── references/      # Optional supporting files
├── hooks/                   # Optional: Event handlers
├── README.md                # Required: Usage documentation
└── LICENSE                  # Required: Open source license
```

#### If your plugin ships skills

Skills are held to the [skill-safety check](https://sigistry.com/skill-verification), because a SKILL.md is injected into the agent's context when it triggers:

- **Name**: lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, exactly matching the directory name; must not shadow a built-in Claude Code command or one of your own commands
- **Description**: an honestly-scoped trigger describing when the skill applies (no "use on every request")
- **Content**: no instruction-override, concealment, or exfiltration language; documentation that teaches attack patterns defensively is fine
- **Scripts**: nothing that pipes remote content to a shell, decodes hidden payloads, touches credential files, or sends secrets off-machine; matches inside security-detector definitions and test fixtures are recorded as accepted context, not failed
- Container layouts (`skills/<container>/<variant>/SKILL.md`, e.g. i18n packs) are supported

#### Required: plugin.json

Your `plugin.json` must include:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what your plugin does",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-repo",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

#### Required: README.md

Your README should include:
- Clear description of what the plugin does
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- List of all commands/features
- Any dependencies or requirements
- License information

### 2. Test Your Plugin Locally

Before submitting, test your plugin thoroughly:

```bash
# Install Claude Code (if not already installed)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Test your plugin locally
cd your-plugin-directory
# Run your commands and verify they work as expected
```

### 3. Publish Your Plugin Repository

Your plugin should be hosted in a public Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.):

```bash
# Create a new repository for your plugin
# Example: https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-name

# Push your plugin code to the repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial plugin release"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

Ensure your repository is publicly accessible so users can install your plugin.

### 4. Fork and Clone the Marketplace

```bash
# Fork the marketplace repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marketplace.git
cd marketplace
```

### 5. Add Your Plugin to marketplace.json

Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to add your plugin entry:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b add-your-plugin-name

# Edit the marketplace.json file
```

Add your plugin to the `plugins` array using the Git URL format:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "source": {
    "source": "url",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-name.git"
  },
  "description": "Clear, concise description of what your plugin does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": [
    "category",
    "relevant",
    "tags"
  ],
  "strict": false
}
```

**Important**: The `source` field tells Claude Code where to find your plugin. We use the Git URL format which supports any Git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted, etc.).

#### Source Field Options

While we recommend the Git URL format shown above, the source field supports multiple formats:

1. **Git URL (Recommended)** - Works with any Git hosting:
```json
"source": {
  "source": "url",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-plugin-name.git"
}
```

2. **GitHub (Alternative)** - Shorthand for GitHub repositories:
```json
"source": {
  "source": "github",
  "repo": "yourusername/your-plugin-name"
}
```

3. **Relative Path** - Only for plugins hosted in this repository:
```json
"source": "./plugins/your-plugin-name"
```

For external submissions, always use option 1 (Git URL format).

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
git commit -m "Add [your-plugin-name] plugin to marketplace"

# Push to your fork
git push origin add-your-plugin-name
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Pull Request"
3. Select the "Plugin Submission" template
4. Fill out all sections of the template:
   - Plugin name and description
   - Link to your plugin repository
   - Brief explanation of what it does
   - Testing steps you've completed
5. Submit your PR

### 7. Review Process

After submission:

1. **Automated Checks** - Our GitHub Actions will validate your:
   - Plugin repository accessibility
   - Plugin structure and metadata
   - marketplace.json syntax
   - For vendored (Verified-tier) submissions: the full eight-check verification methodology, including a stale-`verified.json` gate
2. **Manual Review** - We'll review your plugin for:
   - Code quality and security
   - Functionality and usefulness
   - Documentation completeness
   - Compatibility with Claude Code
3. **Feedback** - We may request changes or improvements to either:
   - Your plugin repository
   - Your marketplace.json entry
4. **Approval** - Once approved, we'll:
   - Merge your marketplace.json entry
   - Your plugin will be available for installation via Claude Code
   - Users will install directly from your repository

## Listing Policy

Passing the checks is necessary but not sufficient. We decline listings that:

- Require payment or a paid account to deliver their core function
- Gate basic functionality behind credentials to third-party services without clear, upfront disclosure
- Violate the terms of service of the tools they integrate with
- Conflict with the registry's values, even when the verifier passes cleanly; a clean static analysis does not obligate a listing

Declines are explained, and authors are welcome to address the reason and resubmit.

## Plugin Guidelines

### Do

- Write clear, helpful documentation
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Use descriptive command names
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow security best practices
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Use semantic versioning

### Don't

- Submit malicious code
- Include credentials or API keys
- Require paid services without clear documentation
- Copy other plugins without permission
- Use offensive or inappropriate content
- Submit untested code

## Quality Standards

We look for plugins that:

- **Solve a real problem** - Provide genuine value to Claude Code users
- **Are well-documented** - Clear README with examples
- **Work reliably** - Tested and functional
- **Are secure** - No vulnerabilities or malicious code
- **Follow conventions** - Use standard Claude Code patterns

## Categories

We organize plugins into categories:
- **Security** - Security scanning, vulnerability analysis
- **Testing** - Test generation, test runners
- **Documentation** - Docs generation, API documentation
- **Code Quality** - Linting, formatting, refactoring
- **Performance** - Profiling, optimization
- **DevOps** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- **AI/ML** - Machine learning, data science tools
- **Utilities** - General-purpose tools

Choose appropriate tags for your plugin.

## Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH** version for bug fixes

## Licensing

All plugins must use an open source license:
- MIT (recommended)
- Apache 2.0
- BSD
- GPL (any version)

## Updates

To update an existing plugin:

1. Update your plugin code in your repository
2. Increment the version in `plugin.json` following semantic versioning
3. Create a Git tag for the new version (optional but recommended)
4. Update the version in marketplace.json (submit a PR to this repo)
5. Include a clear changelog in your PR description

Users will automatically get updates when they pull from your plugin repository.
