   ```

2. **Generate unit tests for core logic**:
   ```
   /generate-unit-tests src/services/
   ```

3. **Create E2E tests for critical flows**:
   ```
   /generate-e2e-tests user registration
   /generate-e2e-tests checkout process
   ```

4. **Verify coverage**:
   ```
   /test-gap-analysis
   ```

### For Existing Projects:

1. **Audit current test coverage**:
   ```
   /test-gap-analysis
   ```

2. **Generate tests for high-priority gaps**:
   ```
   /generate-unit-tests src/payment/processor.ts
   ```

3. **Improve existing test quality**:
   ```
   /improve-test-quality tests/services/user-service.test.ts
   ```

4. **Add E2E tests for critical workflows**:
   ```
   /generate-e2e-tests checkout flow
   ```

### Regular Maintenance:

Run weekly or before major releases:

```
/test-gap-analysis
```

This identifies new untested code and provides a prioritized list of test additions needed.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed
- Claude Code version compatible with plugins feature
- Testing framework installed in your project (Jest, Pytest, etc.)

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Command:

- **Starting a new feature**: `/generate-unit-tests` as you write code
- **Building a new workflow**: `/generate-e2e-tests` for the complete flow
- **Before a release**: `/test-gap-analysis` to ensure coverage
- **Need test data**: `/test-data-factory` for models and fixtures
- **Code review prep**: `/improve-test-quality` on modified tests
- **Legacy code**: `/test-gap-analysis` → `/generate-unit-tests` for gaps

### Testing Tips:

1. **Test as you code**: Generate tests immediately after writing functions
2. **Cover edge cases**: Don't just test happy paths
3. **Use realistic data**: Generate test data that matches production
4. **Keep tests fast**: Mock external dependencies
5. **Run tests frequently**: Integrate with CI/CD
6. **Maintain test quality**: Regularly run `/improve-test-quality`

## Real-World Scenarios

```

**Result**: Systematic identification and testing of gaps, reaching coverage goals efficiently.

---

### Scenario 2: "I wrote a complex validation function and need comprehensive tests"

**Problem**: Need to test all edge cases and error conditions.

**Solution**:
```
/generate-unit-tests src/utils/validator.ts
```

**Result**: Complete test suite covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.

---

### Scenario 3: "Our tests are flaky and hard to maintain"

**Problem**: Existing tests fail intermittently and have poor assertions.

**Solution**:
```
/improve-test-quality tests/services/
```

**Result**: Refactored tests with better assertions, proper mocks, and improved reliability.

---

### Scenario 4: "Need to test the entire checkout workflow"

**Problem**: Complex multi-step process needs end-to-end testing.

**Solution**:
```
/generate-e2e-tests checkout workflow
```

**Result**: Complete E2E test suite covering all checkout scenarios and edge cases.

---

### Scenario 5: "Setting up test data is tedious and time-consuming"

**Problem**: Manually creating test fixtures for every test.

**Solution**:
```

- **Test Generator**: Generates complete tests with edge cases, mocks, and realistic data

## Troubleshooting

### "Generated tests don't match my testing framework"
Test Generator auto-detects frameworks from package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc. Ensure your testing framework is properly configured in your project.

### "Tests are too basic"
Use `/improve-test-quality` to enhance generated tests, or provide specific requirements when generating.

### "Missing edge cases"
Review the generated tests and run `/generate-unit-tests` with specific edge cases mentioned.

### "Test data doesn't match my domain"
Edit the generated factories to match your domain requirements. Test Generator provides a starting point.
