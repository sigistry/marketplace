# SEO Optimizer

[![Verified by Sigistry](https://sigistry.com/badge/seo-optimizer.svg)](https://sigistry.com/plugin/seo-optimizer)

Comprehensive SEO plugin for Claude Code. Audit, optimize, and review website content for search engines, and now make your site legible to AI answer engines too with built-in **llms.txt** generation and validation.

## Purpose

The SEO Optimizer plugin helps developers and content creators implement SEO best practices directly from the command line. It audits existing SEO implementation, optimizes content for search, and applies precision micro-edits that improve discoverability without altering the original voice or style.

**New in 1.1.0: AI discoverability.** Search is no longer only ten blue links. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews read sites too, and they look for signals classic SEO ignores. The plugin now generates and validates [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org), checks AI-crawler access in robots.txt (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended), and flags content that AI crawlers cannot read. Run `/llms-audit` for the full pass.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sigistry/marketplace
```

```bash
/plugin install seo-optimizer@sigistry
```

## Usage

### Commands

#### `/seo-audit` - SEO Compliance Audit

Perform a comprehensive SEO audit on HTML files or web applications.

```bash
# Audit a specific file
/seo-audit src/index.html

# Audit an entire directory
/seo-audit ./public

# Audit a Next.js app
/seo-audit app/layout.tsx
```

**What it checks:**
- Essential meta tags (title, description, viewport)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card tags
- Heading hierarchy (H1-H6 structure)
- Image alt text
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- Canonical URLs
- Structured data (Schema.org)

#### `/seo-optimize` - Content Optimization

Apply minimal, high-precision SEO edits to improve organic search performance.

```bash
# Optimize a content file
/seo-optimize content/blog/my-article.md

# Optimize an HTML page
/seo-optimize pages/about.html
```

**What it does:**
- Enhances keyword placement naturally
- Optimizes headings for search intent
- Improves meta-friendly structure
- Adds internal linking opportunities
- Preserves original voice and tone

#### `/seo-reviewer` - Micro-Edit Review

Apply minimal SEO micro-edits as part of a content review pipeline. Stricter than optimize, with a 5% character change limit.

```bash
# Review and apply micro-edits
/seo-reviewer content/landing-page.md
```

**Constraints:**
- Maximum 5% character change
- No alteration of voice or narrative
- YMYL content protection (health/finance/legal)
- No fabrication of facts or data

#### `/llms-audit` - AI Discoverability & llms.txt

Audit whether your site is legible to AI answer engines and agents, and generate a compliant `llms.txt` when one is missing.

```bash
# Audit a local project (finds the web root)
/llms-audit ./

# Audit a live site
/llms-audit https://example.com
```

**What it does:**
- Checks for a valid `/llms.txt` (and `/llms-full.txt`) per the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) standard
- Generates a curated `llms.txt` from your real pages when one is missing
- Reports AI-crawler access in robots.txt (GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, CCBot)
- Flags content AI crawlers cannot read (JS-only rendering, missing answer-shaped schema)

Crawler access is treated as an owner policy decision: the audit reports the tradeoff and never changes robots.txt on its own.

### Skill

#### SEO Expert

Activate the SEO Expert skill for interactive consultation on SEO topics.

**Expertise areas:**
- Technical SEO (crawlability, Core Web Vitals, structured data)
- On-page SEO (meta tags, headings, content optimization)
- Platform-specific SEO (Next.js, React, Vue, WordPress)
- AI discoverability & GEO (llms.txt, AI-crawler policy, getting cited in AI answers)
- Content strategy and search intent

**Example interactions:**
- "How do I implement structured data for my blog?"
- "What's wrong with my meta tag setup?"
- "Help me optimize this page for Core Web Vitals"
- "Set up an llms.txt so ChatGPT and Perplexity can read my site"
- "Which AI crawlers is my robots.txt blocking?"

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Audit Existing SEO

Start by auditing your current SEO implementation:

```bash
/seo-audit ./src
```

This generates a comprehensive report with:
- Overall SEO score
- Critical issues to fix immediately
- Warnings to review
- Passed checks
- Prioritized recommendations

### 2. Fix Critical Issues

Use the SEO Expert skill to understand and fix critical issues:

```
User: The audit found my site is missing structured data. How do I add it?
SEO Expert: [Provides framework-specific implementation guidance]
```

### 3. Optimize Content

Run the optimizer on content pages:

```bash
/seo-optimize content/services.md
```

Review the changes and apply them to your files.

### 4. Final Review

Before publishing, run the micro-editor for final polish:

```bash
/seo-reviewer content/services.md
```

This applies conservative, high-precision edits that won't alter your voice.
