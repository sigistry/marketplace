## Short Description

Local-first FHIR R4 validation, Implementation Guide diagnostics, and CI quality workflows for Claude Code.

## Long Description

Records helps FHIR developers, Implementation Guide authors, and AI agents validate HL7 FHIR R4 JSON, explain `OperationOutcome` and profile issues, diagnose FSH/SUSHI and IG Publisher projects, add CI quality gates, and run validate-patch-revalidate workflows with Claude Code.

The `fhir-validation` skill is local-first and privacy-oriented. It uses Records MCP tools when available, a user-configured Records API when explicitly configured, the local `records validate-file` CLI when available, configured IG/SUSHI/Firely/HAPI validators for profile-aware workflows, or a clearly labeled structural fallback when no Records runtime is available.

Version 0.8.3 documents the Sigistry listing, where Records is published as a Verified-tier plugin audited against the registry's public verification methodology. Version 0.8.2 narrowed the read-only `fhir-validation-reviewer` agent to an explicit least-privilege tool allow-list and documented the in-session `/plugin install` commands. Version 0.8.1 improved marketplace discovery for high-intent FHIR validator, conformance, Implementation Guide, SUSHI, and CI searches; aligned icons and screenshots with the MedVertical brand system; and moved generated GitHub Actions workflows to Node 24 and `actions/*@v5`.

Unlike validator-specific runbooks, Records positions Claude around a data-quality workflow: validate, explain, patch safe mechanical issues, revalidate, and escalate domain-dependent clinical values instead of inventing placeholders.

## Privacy

The plugin is local-first. It instructs Claude not to send clinical or patient data to external services unless the user explicitly configured that service or clearly consented. See `PRIVACY.md`.

It includes operational privacy helpers for redacted summaries and explicit consent gates for FHIR URLs, hosted APIs, terminology servers, and validator installation.

## Commands and Agent

- `/records:doctor`
- `/records:validate`
- `/records:init-ci`
- `/records:explain-outcome`
- `/records:derive-quality-rules`
- `records:fhir-validation-reviewer` read-only agent

## Release Quality

Release checks include pinned Claude plugin validation, a clean Codex marketplace install/discovery check, component smoke tests, synthetic and published-IG fixtures, result-contract checks, runtime/privacy/package checks, bounded-input checks, structural validation, slicing, and PHI redaction snapshots.
