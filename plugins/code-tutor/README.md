## What Makes Code Tutor Unique

### The Code Tutor Skill: Your Persistent Teaching Companion

Unlike commands that give one-off answers, the **Code Tutor skill** provides an ongoing teaching relationship:

- **Remembers Context**: Maintains conversation history to build on previous learning
- **Adapts Teaching Style**: Adjusts complexity based on your responses
- **Socratic Method**: Asks guiding questions instead of just giving answers
- **Growth Focused**: Frames mistakes as learning opportunities
- **Personalized**: Learns your skill level and tailors explanations accordingly

**Example interaction**:
```
You: "I don't understand closures"

Code Tutor: "Great topic! Let me start with a question: Have you worked with
functions that return other functions before? Even if you haven't, that's
totally fine - we'll build up to it together."

[Adapts based on your response, guides discovery through questions]
```

### Supporting Commands: Focused Learning Tools

Four specialized commands complement the skill for specific learning tasks:

1. **`/explain-code`** - Break down complex code into understandable explanations
2. **`/practice-exercise`** - Generate personalized coding exercises
3. **`/code-review-teach`** - Educational code reviews with constructive feedback

## Installation

First, add the Sigistry marketplace (if you haven't already):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sigistry/marketplace
```

Then install Code Tutor:

```bash
/plugin install code-tutor@sigistry
```

Or use the interactive browser:

```bash
/plugin
```

## Getting Started

### Using the Code Tutor Skill

The Code Tutor skill activates automatically when you engage in teaching-oriented conversations. Simply start asking questions or request learning help naturally:

```
You: "I want to learn about React hooks"

Code Tutor: "Excellent! Hooks are a powerful feature. Before we dive in,
tell me: Have you worked with React class components before, or is this
your first time with React?"

[Interactive learning conversation continues...]
```

The skill stays active throughout your session, remembering context and building on previous explanations.

### Using Individual Commands

Commands work standalone without activating the skill:

```bash
# Explain specific code
/explain-code src/utils/debounce.js

# Generate practice exercise
/practice-exercise
→ "I want to practice promises and error handling"

# Get educational code review
/code-review-teach src/api/auth.ts

# Deep dive into concept
/concept-deep-dive event-loop
```

## Learning Workflows

### Workflow 1: Learning a New Concept

```
1. /concept-deep-dive [concept-name]
   → Get comprehensive explanation with examples

2. /explain-code [file-using-concept]
   → See the concept in action in your codebase

3. /practice-exercise
   → Practice implementing the concept yourself

4. /code-review-teach [your-implementation]
   → Get feedback on your practice implementation
```

**Example**: Learning async/await
```
/concept-deep-dive async/await
/explain-code src/api/client.js
/practice-exercise → "async/await with error handling"
/code-review-teach src/services/user-service.js
```

### Workflow 2: Understanding Existing Code

```
1. /explain-code [confusing-file]
   → Get explanation of what code does

2. /concept-deep-dive [pattern-used]
   → Deep dive into patterns/concepts used

3. Ask follow-up questions naturally
   → The Code Tutor skill will activate for interactive teaching

4. /practice-exercise
   → Practice similar patterns
```

**Example**: Understanding middleware
```
/explain-code src/middleware/auth.js
/concept-deep-dive middleware-pattern
"How would I add rate limiting middleware?" → Code Tutor skill activates
/practice-exercise → "Implement custom middleware"
```

## Teaching Philosophy

Code Tutor is built on proven teaching principles:

### 1. Socratic Method
Guides discovery through questions rather than lecturing. Builds critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### 2. Constructivism
Learners construct knowledge by building on existing understanding. Each explanation connects new to familiar concepts.

### 3. Zone of Proximal Development
Challenges slightly beyond current ability level, with support to bridge the gap. Not too easy (boring) or too hard (frustrating).

### 4. Deliberate Practice
Focused, goal-oriented practice with immediate feedback. Exercises target specific skills for measurable improvement.

### 5. Growth Mindset
Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. Emphasizes effort and progress over innate ability.

### 6. Contextual Learning
Grounds abstract concepts in familiar code. Makes learning relevant and immediately applicable.

### 7. Metacognition
Helps you think about your thinking. Builds self-awareness of learning process and problem-solving strategies.

## Skill Level Adaptation

Code Tutor automatically adapts to your level:

### Beginner Developers
**Approach**:
- Simple, non-technical language
- Extensive use of analogies
- Step-by-step explanations
- High encouragement and patience
- Focus on fundamentals

**Example**:
```
"Think of a function like a recipe. You give it ingredients (parameters),
it follows steps (the function body), and gives you back a finished dish
(the return value)."
```

### Intermediate Developers
**Approach**:
- Balanced theory and practice
- Introduces design patterns
- Discusses best practices
- Encourages critical thinking
- Explores trade-offs

**Example**:
```
"You're using a for loop here, which works perfectly. Have you considered
using map() instead? Let's explore when each approach is more appropriate
and the trade-offs involved..."
```

### Advanced Developers
**Approach**:
- Deep technical discussions
- Performance implications
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Architectural considerations
- Industry best practices

**Example**:
```
"Interesting use of the singleton pattern here. Let's discuss implications
for testability and potential issues in concurrent environments. What led
you to choose this over dependency injection?"
```

## Tips for Effective Learning

### 1. Be Specific About Your Goals
```
❌ "Teach me JavaScript"
✅ "I want to understand closures and where they're useful"
```

### 2. Ask Follow-Up Questions
Don't hesitate to say:
- "I don't understand this part"
- "Can you explain that differently?"
- "Can you show an example from my codebase?"

### 3. Practice Immediately
After learning a concept, use `/practice-exercise` to reinforce it while fresh.

### 4. Review Your Own Code
Use `/code-review-teach` on code you've written to learn from your own work.

### 5. Embrace Mistakes
Mistakes in exercises and practice are learning opportunities, not failures.

### 6. Build on Previous Learning
Code Tutor skill remembers context - reference earlier topics in the conversation.

### 7. Connect to Real Work
Always ask "How does this apply to my current project?"

### 8. Teach to Learn
After learning something, explain it back to Code Tutor. Teaching reinforces learning.
